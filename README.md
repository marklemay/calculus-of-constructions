# calculus-of-constructions
a simple implementation of the pure calculus of constructions


## TODO
 * a notion of constructions that sits on top of the theory
 * talk to will
 * correct spelling
 * add scala docs
 * clean up pom
 * parser more efficient
 * implicitly index everything by constructions
 * CI
 * TESTs
 * there is much more information that could be included in the quick check tests
   * lots of redundent checks with the defualt generator
   * can shrink in a binding aware way
   *could generate closed expressions
   * could even generate well typed expressions (sort of)
   * tinycheck would be better for this, but noones built it in scala yet
 * toScala?
 * possible to abstract away the details of variables?
 * expession problem 
 * a web UI would be cool
 * some automation would be cool
